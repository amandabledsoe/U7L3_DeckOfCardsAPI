This my solution for Unit 7: Lab 3 "Deck of Cards API" in the 2022 C# .NET After-Hours Boot Camp at Grand Circus.

# DECK OF CARDS API
### Objective: 
- Consuming an API, Processing JSON

### Task: 
- Work with an API that generates JSON data to display information on a web page. 


### Build Specifications:
- Work with the Deck of Cards API, documented at https://deckofcardsapi.com/
- Make a call to the API to generate a new deck.  Capture the deck ID returned.
- Draw 5 cards from the deck and display their names and images inside a web page.

### Hints:
- Install a browser plugin to view JSON data such as: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en


### Extra Challenges:
- On the page that displays the cards, have a button to draw the next 5 cards from the same deck.  You'll need to pass the ID along, either coded into the URL or as a hidden field.
- Add "Keep" functionality to the cards view.  When the user clicks the draw again button, keep the cards they chose to keep and only draw to replace the others.  (Checkboxes might be the easiest way to accomplish the keep.)
